            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the contemporary era of rapid technological advancement, optimizing energy efficiency in modern computing systems has emerged as a critical challenge and an area of intensive research. The push towards more sustainable and energy-efficient computing practices is driven by the exponential growth in data processing needs, the proliferation of cloud computing, and the ubiquitous deployment of internet-connected devices. The quest for minimizing energy consumption while maximizing performance has led to the exploration of advanced architectural techniques that promise significant improvements in energy efficiency. This literature review aims to dissect the myriad of strategies and innovations in computer architecture that contribute to energy conservation, ranging from novel processing units and memory management techniques to predictive models and energy-aware algorithms. By synthesizing findings from cutting-edge research, including studies on Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) optimizations, Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) enhancements, dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), and the implementation of machine learning algorithms for energy prediction, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art approaches to energy-efficient computing. Through the lens of recent advancements and empirical studies, we aim to highlight the effectiveness of these architectural innovations, identify prevailing challenges, and propose future directions for research in optimizing energy efficiency in modern computing systems.

            <h2>Result</h2>
            <p>In this section, we delve into the multifaceted strategies and innovations that have been explored to enhance energy efficiency in modern computing systems through advanced architectural techniques. Our discussion encompasses a range of approaches from hardware optimizations, such as Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) adjustments and Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) enhancements, to software interventions like dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) and predictive modeling. Each strategy is examined for its potential to reduce energy consumption while maintaining or improving performance, illustrating the complexity and necessity of cross-disciplinary efforts in achieving sustainable computing practices.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>NUMA Optimizations: The efficiency improvements in systems utilizing NUMA come from strategic data placement and task scheduling, which minimizes cross-node memory access. This approach reduces the energy consumption associated with data transfers and processing, making it a critical consideration in the design of multi-processor systems [1].</li>
                <li>SMT Enhancements: By allowing multiple threads to execute simultaneously on a single core, SMT technology can increase the throughput of a processor, leading to better energy efficiency. This is especially true for workloads that can be parallelized effectively, as it reduces the need for higher clock speeds and, consequently, energy usage [2].</li>
                <li>DVFS: The principle behind DVFS is to adjust the processor's operating frequency and voltage based on the current workload requirements. This dynamic adjustment leads to significant energy savings, particularly in systems where workloads vary considerably over time. It allows for a balance between performance and power consumption, optimizing for energy efficiency without compromising on computational needs [3].</li>
                <li>Predictive Models for Energy Savings: Leveraging predictive models based on machine learning to forecast system workload and adjust parameters in real-time offers a proactive approach to energy saving. These models can accurately predict periods of high and low demand, enabling systems to dynamically scale resources and energy consumption accordingly. This not only reduces energy waste but also ensures that performance levels meet the required thresholds [4].</li>
                <li>Memory-Centric Architectural Techniques: The shift towards memory-centric architectures addresses the growing energy demands of processing large volumes of data. By optimizing memory access and storage, these techniques reduce the energy overhead associated with data-intensive operations. This is particularly relevant in the era of big data and AI, where efficient data processing is crucial for both performance and energy conservation [5].</li>
