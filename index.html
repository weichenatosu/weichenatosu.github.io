    <h2>Project Synopsis</h2>
    <p>In the contemporary digital age, the proliferation of computing systems across various sectors has underscored the critical need for energy optimization strategies that not only propel technological innovation but also adhere to sustainable practices. This final year project, spearheaded by Yu-Yang Ting and Wei Chen, embarks on an exploratory journey to delve deep into the realm of energy efficiency within computing systems. By meticulously sifting through and synthesizing findings from a plethora of scholarly articles and research papers, our endeavor aims to illuminate the path towards more energy-conservative computing paradigms, potentially revolutionizing how energy efficiency is perceived and implemented across the board.</p>

    <h2>The Significance of Energy Efficiency</h2>
    <p>The quest for energy efficiency in computing systems transcends mere cost-saving measures; it embodies the urgent call for environmental stewardship in the face of escalating global energy demands and the looming threat of climate change. The implications of achieving substantial energy reductions in computing are multifaceted, ranging from significantly lower electricity bills for consumers and businesses alike to a marked reduction in carbon emissions, thereby mitigating the environmental impact of digital operations. Through our research, we aim to contribute to a growing body of knowledge that supports the development of greener, more energy-efficient technologies, ensuring that the digital revolution progresses in harmony with our planet's ecological boundaries.</p>

    <h2>Methodological Approach</h2>
    <p>Our methodological framework is grounded in a comprehensive review of existing literature, through which we aim to aggregate and analyze the collective wisdom and insights garnered by the academic and technical communities in the field of energy-efficient computing. This involves a critical examination of various energy optimization strategies, architectural innovations, and hardware advancements reported in scholarly publications. Furthermore, we intend to apply a comparative analysis technique to evaluate the effectiveness and practicality of these strategies in real-world scenarios. By synthesizing the insights obtained from this extensive literature review, our project aspires to distill actionable strategies that can significantly contribute to the advancement of energy efficiency in computing systems.</p>

    <h2>Projected Outcomes</h2>
    <p>The culmination of our research is anticipated to yield a rich tapestry of knowledge, encapsulating a broad spectrum of energy-efficient practices, architectural optimizations, and innovative technologies that promise to redefine the landscape of computing with an eye towards sustainability. We envisage compiling our findings into a comprehensive report that not only highlights the most effective energy optimization strategies but also offers a blueprint for future research and development in the field. Ultimately, our project seeks to foster a greater understanding among stakeholders—ranging from policymakers to industry practitioners and academic researchers—about the importance of energy efficiency and the viable pathways towards achieving it in the computing domain.</p>
