    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In today's world, computing systems are the backbone of technological advancement, driving innovation across various sectors. However, the environmental impact of these systems, particularly in terms of energy consumption, has become a growing concern. This project, led by Yu-Yang Ting and Wei Chen, aims to address this critical issue by exploring advanced architectural techniques to significantly enhance the energy efficiency of modern computing systems. Our goal is not just to innovate but to set a new standard for how energy efficiency can be integrated into the very foundation of computing technology.</p>

    <h2>The Importance of Energy Efficiency</h2>
    <p>As digital technologies permeate every aspect of our lives, the demand for computing power continues to soar. This increase in demand leads to a corresponding rise in energy consumption, posing challenges not only to environmental sustainability but also to the economic viability of computing operations. Through this project, we aim to delve deep into the mechanisms of computing architectures, identifying opportunities for optimization and efficiency improvements that could have far-reaching implications for the industry and the environment alike.</p>

    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
    <p>Our methodology is comprehensive, blending theoretical research with practical experimentation. We will begin with a thorough review of existing literature to build a solid foundation of understanding. From there, we will engage in empirical research, employing simulations and real-world testing to evaluate the effectiveness of various architectural innovations. By collaborating with industry experts and leveraging cutting-edge technology, we aim to uncover actionable insights that can drive significant advancements in energy efficiency.</p>

    <h2>Anticipated Impact</h2>
    <p>The implications of this project are far-reaching. By successfully optimizing energy efficiency in computing systems, we can reduce operational costs, decrease environmental impact, and pave the way for more sustainable technological development. This research has the potential to influence not only the design of future computing systems but also the strategic direction of organizations and industries that rely heavily on computing technology. Ultimately, our work aims to contribute to a more sustainable, efficient, and responsible computing landscape.</p>
